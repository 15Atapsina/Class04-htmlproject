		<h3>What Is Artificial Intelligence(AI)?</h3>
		<p><b>Artificial intelligence (AI)</b> refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.
		   The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.
           The ideal <i>characteristic of artificial intelligence</i> is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal.
		   A subset of artificial intelligence is <em>machine learning (ML)</em>, which refers to the concept that computer programs can automatically learn from and adapt to new data without being assisted by humans.
		   Deep learning techniques enable this automatic learning through the absorption of huge amounts of unstructured data such as text, images, or video.</p>
		<h3>Understanding Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3>
		<p>When most people hear the term <abbr title="artificial intelligence">ai</abbr>,the first thing they usually think of is robots.
		   That's because big-budget films and novels weave stories about human-like machines that wreak havoc on <small>Earth</small>.
		   But nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
		<h3>Applications of Artificial Intelligence</h3>

		   <del>The application for AI are endless.</del><ins>The technology can be applied to many different sectors and industries.</ins>
		   AI is being tested and used in the healthcare industry for dosing drugs and doling out different treatments tailored to specific patients,
		   and for aiding in surgical procedures in the operating room.<strong>Artificial intelligence</strong> also has applications in the financial industry,where it is used to detect and flag activity in banking and finance such as unusual debit card usage and large account depositsâ€”all of which help a bank's fraud department.
		   Applications for AI are also being used to help streamline and make trading easier.This is done by making supply,demand,and pricing of securities easier to estimate.</blockquote></p>
